# VulnFounder Two-Stage Vulnerability Analysis

**Created**: December 26, 2024
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED WITH ATTACKER SIMULATION (January 14, 2026)

---

## Overview

VulnFounder uses a two-stage approach for vulnerability analysis. Stage 1 detects potential issues with simple, direct prompts. Stage 2 verifies each finding using Opus with tool access to explore the codebase.

### 阶段职责边界（当前实现）

可达性筛选和上下文构建发生在 Stage 1 之前，只负责把结构证据交给分析器：
入口类型、函数身份、调用边、候选路径和已知的注册/分派关系。它不要求提前完成
参数级 source-to-sink 数据流，也不会因为数据流尚未追踪就把单元排除。

Stage 1 仍然是漏洞检测阶段，负责判断目标函数中的缺陷、局部危险操作、校验和
可能影响；如果结论依赖尚未找到的下游或输入传播证据，应保留为
`inconclusive`，而不是默认 `safe`/`protected`。

Stage 2 负责定向验证参数 source-to-sink、共享状态读写顺序、异步载荷、分派条件、
权限支配关系和最终 sink 可触发性。Stage 1 结果现在携带 `stage_context`，其中
`stage1` 保存结构路径状态，`stage2` 保存待验证的数据流状态；Stage 2 会读取该
交接信息并在 `assessment.parameter_dataflow_status` 中记录验证结果。

## Key Insight: Simple Prompts Work Better

The original implementation had complex, multi-step instructions. Testing revealed that **simple, direct prompts produce better results**:

- Ask direct questions: "What does this code do?" and "What is the security risk?"
- Trust the model's capabilities
- Use nuanced categories instead of binary VULNERABLE/SAFE

---

## Finding Categories

Five categories capture the spectrum of security states:

| Category | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `vulnerable` | Exploitable vulnerability, no protection | Immediate fix required |
| `bypassable` | Security controls exist but can be circumvented | Review and strengthen |
| `inconclusive` | Security posture cannot be determined | Manual review needed |
| `protected` | Handles dangerous operations with effective controls | Monitor |
| `safe` | No security-sensitive operations | None |

---

## Stage 1: Vulnerability Detection

**Prompt:** Simple and direct

```
Assess this code for security.

## Context
Route: {route}
Files: {files}
Pre-analysis hint: {security_classification}

## Code
```{language}
{code}
```

## Response
1. What does this code do?
2. What is the security risk?

Provide your assessment as JSON:
{
    "finding": "safe" | "protected" | "bypassable" | "vulnerable" | "inconclusive",
    "attack_vector": "How this could be exploited, or null if safe/protected",
    "reasoning": "...",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}
```

**Implementation:** `prompts/vulnerability_analysis.py`

---

## Stage 2: Finding Verification (Attacker Simulation)

Stage 2 verifies **all findings** using Opus with tool access and **attacker simulation**.

**Key Breakthrough (Jan 14, 2026):** Changed from "code analysis mode" to "attacker simulation mode". The model role-plays as an attacker with only a browser, attempting to exploit the vulnerability step-by-step. This naturally surfaces roadblocks that make theoretical vulnerabilities unexploitable.

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a penetration tester. You only report vulnerabilities you can actually exploit.
```

**User Prompt:**
```
Stage 1 claims this function is **{finding}**.
Their reasoning: {reasoning}

>>> TARGET FUNCTION <<<
{primary_code}

Context:
{context_code}

---

You are an attacker on the internet. You have a browser and nothing else.
No server access, no admin credentials, no ability to modify files on the server.

Try to exploit this code using MULTIPLE different approaches. Think about:
- What different inputs can you control?
- What different properties/fields can you manipulate?
- What different endpoints or entry points exist?

For EACH approach, trace through step by step until you succeed or hit a blocker.

IMPORTANT:
- Only conclude PROTECTED or SAFE if ALL approaches fail. If ANY approach succeeds, conclude VULNERABLE.
- A vulnerability must harm someone OTHER than the attacker.
```

**Why it works:**

1. **Attacker Simulation:** The model has the knowledge to identify false positives, but only applies it when forced to **simulate being an attacker** rather than **analyze code**. When simulating an attack, the model naturally hits roadblocks:
   - "I can't create symlinks on the server because I don't have filesystem access"
   - "I can only SELECT from admin-configured endpoints, not provide arbitrary URLs"

2. **Multi-Approach Requirement:** Single-path exploration missed vulnerabilities where one property was protected but another wasn't (e.g., `workspaceId` protected but `id` injectable for mass assignment). Requiring MULTIPLE approaches ensures exhaustive testing.

**Results:** 0 false positives on object-browser (25 units)

### Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `search_usages` | Find where a function is called |
| `search_definitions` | Find where a function is defined |
| `read_function` | Get full function code by ID |
| `list_functions` | List all functions in a file |
| `finish` | Complete verification with verdict |

**Implementation:**
- `utilities/finding_verifier.py` - Main verification logic
- `prompts/verification_prompts.py` - Attacker simulation prompts (moved from utilities/ Jan 14)

## Test Results

### Object-Browser (25 units - Attacker Simulation)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Units analyzed | 25 |
| Final VULNERABLE | **0** |
| Final SAFE | 23 |
| Final PROTECTED | 2 |
| False positive rate | **0%** |

**Prompt evolution:** 10 → 5 → 3 → 2 → 0 vulnerabilities over 7 iterations

**False positive categories eliminated:**
1. Admin-controlled input treated as attack vector (CLI args, config files)
2. Standard security patterns misidentified (OAuth/STS URL parameters)
3. Platform security boundaries ignored (S3 ACLs, admin-configured endpoints)
4. Context confusion/hallucination (model attributed concerns from context to target)

### Flowise (13 units)

| Stage 2 Outcome | Count |
|-----------------|-------|
| Agreed with Stage 1 | 11 |
| Corrected Stage 1 | 2 |

**Corrections made:**
- Playwright: protected → vulnerable (symlink bypass)
- Puppeteer: protected → vulnerable (symlink bypass)

**Final distribution:**

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| vulnerable | 5 |
| bypassable | 7 |
| protected | 1 |

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Attacker simulation > Code analysis**: Force the model to role-play as an attacker, not analyze code
2. **No rules needed**: The constraint "you have a browser and nothing else" replaces complex rules
3. **Simple prompts**: Direct questions work better than complex instructions
4. **Nuanced categories**: 5-level spectrum captures security reality
5. **Verify all findings**: Stage 2 checks everything, not just vulnerabilities
6. **Target function marking**: Clear `>>> TARGET FUNCTION <<<` markers prevent context confusion
