"""Custom threat models: schema v1, loud validation, and legacy-field derivation.

VulnFounder's built-in security context collapses an entire attacker model into one of
four ``ApplicationType`` values plus a single boolean (``suppress_local_only``). That
cannot express, say, a deployment orchestrator whose real adversary is "a developer
with commit access to a watched manifest repo and no shell on the orchestrator" —
neither the "remote attacker with a browser" nor the "local user with shell access"
persona fits, and picking either one produces systematically wrong verdicts.

A *threat model* replaces the four-value enum with a structured description the repo
author writes: free-form classification, components with free-form component types,
named attacker profiles with explicit CAN/CANNOT capabilities, per-input-source trust
levels, and explicit statements of what is and is not a vulnerability *for this
repository*.

Storage format
--------------
``VULNFOUNDER.THREATMODEL.md`` in the scanned repository's root: human-readable markdown
headings for reviewers and PR diffs, plus **one authoritative fenced ```json block**
that is the machine truth. Markdown-with-embedded-JSON is chosen over YAML
frontmatter because ``check_manual_override`` already proves the seam works with the
same regex, LLMs emit fenced JSON far more reliably than nested YAML, and the
frontmatter path depends on an optional PyYAML import that degrades to a *warning* —
precisely the silent failure this module exists to eliminate.

``parse_threat_model_md`` scans **every** json block and selects the one whose parsed
object carries ``"schema": "vulnfounder-threat-model"``, so a document whose prose
contains illustrative json blocks (a template, a diff, a worked example) still parses.

Loud failure
------------
``load_threat_model`` returns ``None`` **only** when the file is absent. If the file
exists but is malformed it **raises**. This is a deliberate inversion of
``check_manual_override``'s catch-all ``except Exception: print(warning); continue``.
The rationale is asymmetric blast radius: a broken ``VULNFOUNDER.md`` degrades to
LLM-generated context, which is merely worse; a broken ``VULNFOUNDER.THREATMODEL.md``
degrades to the default ``"web_app"`` assumption, which silently inverts the entire
security model of a scan that the operator explicitly asked to be threat-model driven
— and the resulting report looks completely successful. A typo must not be able to
produce a confident, wrong answer.

For the same reason ``ThreatModelValidationError`` collects **all** violations rather
than failing fast on the first: a human fixing a hand-written threat model should see
the whole list in one pass, not play whack-a-mole across N scan invocations.

Known gap: this file originates in the scanned repository and is therefore
attacker-influenceable, and it is NOT prompt-injection-fenced (scanned source code is,
via ``prompts/_fence.py``). See the KNOWN GAP section of
``context/VULNFOUNDER_THREATMODEL_TEMPLATE.md``. Accepted, documented risk.

    """Build an ``ApplicationContext`` from a validated threat model.

    The new schema fields are carried **verbatim** onto the dataclass, and the
    legacy fields are **derived** from them so that every pre-existing consumer
    (``format_context_for_prompt``, ``suppress_local_only``, the analyzer and
    verifier context threading, ``core/llm_reachability``'s raw-JSON dump) keeps
    working without a branch. Threat-model-aware renderers then override the
    legacy rendering where it matters; anything not yet converted degrades to a
    reasonable approximation rather than to nothing.

    Derivations:

    * ``application_type`` — ``"custom:" + slug(classification)``. Namespaced so it
      can never collide with an ``ApplicationType`` value, and so any code that
      compares against the enum simply sees "not one of mine" instead of a
      plausible-looking wrong match.
    * ``trust_boundaries`` — ``{source name: trust level}``, i.e. exactly the legacy
      shape, lowercased. This is what keeps ``suppress_local_only`` semantically
      sane for residual callers.
    * ``requires_remote_trigger`` — true if any attacker profile stands at
      ``position == "remote"`` **or** any input source is ``untrusted``. The second
      disjunct matters: a supply-chain attacker who controls an untrusted manifest
      is not "remote", but suppressing everything they can reach would be wrong.

    findings — that is the feature. But the same mechanism lets a repository

    cannot catch this, because nothing here is malformed. It is a *semantic* attack

    A scanner that reports clean because the audited code said so is worse than no
