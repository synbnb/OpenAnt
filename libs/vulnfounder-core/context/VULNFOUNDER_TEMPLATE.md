# VULNFOUNDER.md Template

This file provides manual security context for VulnFounder vulnerability analysis.
Place this file (named `VULNFOUNDER.md` or `VULNFOUNDER.json`) in your repository root.

## Supported Application Types

VulnFounder supports these four application types:

| Type | Description | Attack Model |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `web_app` | Web applications and API servers | Remote attacker with browser/HTTP client |
| `cli_tool` | Command-line tools and utilities | Local user with shell access (already has filesystem access) |
| `library` | Reusable code packages and SDKs | No direct attack surface; security depends on caller |
| `agent_framework` | AI agent and LLM frameworks | Code execution is intentional; focus on sandbox escapes |

**Note:** Manual overrides can use any `application_type` value (validation is skipped for manual overrides). Use this to analyze unsupported application types by mapping them to the closest supported type.

## Format

Include a JSON code block with the following structure:

```json
{
  "application_type": "web_app",
  "purpose": "Description of what this application does",
  "intended_behaviors": [
    "Behavior that is BY DESIGN, not a vulnerability",
    "Another intended behavior"
  ],
  "trust_boundaries": {
    "input_source": "untrusted|semi_trusted|trusted"
  },
  "security_model": "Description of security approach, or null",
  "not_a_vulnerability": [
    "Specific pattern that should NOT be flagged"
  ],
  "requires_remote_trigger": true,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "evidence": ["Manual configuration by repository maintainers"]
}
```

## Field Descriptions

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `application_type` | string | One of: `web_app`, `cli_tool`, `library`, `agent_framework` |
| `purpose` | string | 1-2 sentence description of what the application does |
| `intended_behaviors` | string[] | Behaviors that are BY DESIGN, not vulnerabilities |
| `trust_boundaries` | object | Maps input sources to trust levels: `untrusted`, `semi_trusted`, `trusted` |
| `security_model` | string\|null | Description of documented security approach |
| `not_a_vulnerability` | string[] | Specific patterns that should NOT be flagged |
| `requires_remote_trigger` | boolean | `true` for web_app, `false` for cli_tool/library/agent_framework |
| `confidence` | number | 0.0-1.0, set to 1.0 for manual config |
| `evidence` | string[] | What led to these conclusions |

```

### CLI Tool (`cli_tool`)

```json

  "confidence": 1.0,
  "evidence": ["Manual configuration"]
}
```

  "evidence": ["Manual configuration"]
}
```

### Agent Framework (`agent_framework`)

```json
{
  "application_type": "agent_framework",
  "purpose": "Framework for building AI agents that execute code and use tools",
  "intended_behaviors": [
    "Executes user-provided code in agent sandbox",
    "Spawns subprocesses to run agent tools",
    "Clones git repositories from user-specified URLs",
    "Makes HTTP requests to user-configured endpoints"

  "not_a_vulnerability": [
    "Subprocess execution in agent tools - this is the core feature",
    "Path traversal in CLI commands - user has filesystem access",
    "Dynamic imports in agent middleware - intentional for extensibility",
    "SSRF in developer-configured base_url - not user-controlled"
  ],

  "confidence": 1.0,
  "evidence": ["Manual configuration by repository maintainers"]
}
```

## Unsupported Application Types

If your application doesn't fit the supported types (e.g., desktop app, mobile app, game), you can still use VulnFounder by:

1. Creating a `VULNFOUNDER.md` with the closest matching type
2. Adding detailed `not_a_vulnerability` entries for patterns specific to your application
3. Setting appropriate `trust_boundaries` for your application's input sources

Example for a desktop application (mapped to `cli_tool`):

```json
{
  "application_type": "cli_tool",
  "purpose": "Desktop application for video editing (mapped from desktop_app)",
  "intended_behaviors": [
    "Reads and writes local video files",
    "Uses GPU for rendering",
    "Saves project files to user-specified paths"
  ],
  "trust_boundaries": {
    "user_interface_input": "semi_trusted",
    "project_files": "semi_trusted",
    "local_files": "trusted"
  },
  "security_model": "Local-only application, no network features",
  "not_a_vulnerability": [
    "Path traversal - user selects files via file picker",
    "File writes - user controls save location",
    "DLL/library loading - local application"
  ],
  "requires_remote_trigger": false,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "evidence": ["Manual configuration - desktop app mapped to cli_tool"]
}
```
