"""Generate rich application context for security analysis.

This module analyzes a repository and generates structured security context
that informs all subsequent vulnerability analysis stages. The context helps
the LLM understand:
- What the application IS and what it's SUPPOSED to do
- What behaviors are INTENTIONAL features (not vulnerabilities)
- What trust boundaries exist
- Whether vulnerabilities require remote exploitation

Supported Application Types:
- web_app: Web applications and API servers (HTTP-based, remote attackers)
- cli_tool: Command-line tools (local user has shell access)
- library: Reusable code packages (no direct attack surface)
- agent_framework: AI agent/LLM frameworks (code execution is intentional)
- openharmony_component: OpenHarmony native, IPC, SA, HDF, or device component

Usage:
    from context import generate_application_context, save_context

    # ``binding`` is the app_context-phase binding from a PhaseRegistry
    # (registry.get("app_context")); it is required.
    context = generate_application_context(Path("/path/to/repo"), binding)
    save_context(context, Path("application_context.json"))

## Repository Information

{sources}

---

## Task

You are preparing context for a security vulnerability scanner. The scanner will analyze individual code units (functions/methods) for vulnerabilities. Your job is to provide application-level context so the scanner understands:

1. What this application IS and what it's SUPPOSED to do
2. What behaviors are INTENTIONAL features (not vulnerabilities)
3. What trust boundaries exist
4. Whether vulnerabilities require remote exploitation or if local-only issues should be flagged

## Supported Application Types

You MUST classify this repository as ONE of the supported types listed below:

""" + _build_type_descriptions() + """

If the repository doesn't fit any of these types (e.g., desktop app, mobile app, game, embedded system), use `application_type: "unsupported"` and explain why in the evidence field.

## Security Model by Type

- **web_app**: Remote attackers via HTTP. SSRF, XSS, SQLi, path traversal are real concerns.
- **cli_tool**: Local user has shell access. Path traversal, file operations are NOT vulnerabilities.
- **library**: No direct attack surface. Vulnerabilities depend on how the caller uses the library.
- **agent_framework**: Code execution is the CORE FEATURE. Focus on sandbox escapes, not code execution itself.
- **openharmony_component**: At minimum, an unprivileged local caller can reach exposed IPC/SA boundaries. Treat Parcel, caller identity, and device-facing data as untrusted until validated.

## Output Format

Respond with a JSON object (no other text):

```json
{{
  "application_type": "web_app|cli_tool|library|agent_framework|openharmony_component|unsupported",
  "purpose": "1-2 sentence description of what this application does",
  "intended_behaviors": [
    "List of behaviors that are BY DESIGN, not vulnerabilities",
    "Be specific - e.g., 'Executes user-provided code in sandboxed environment'",
    "e.g., 'Clones git repositories from user-specified URLs'",
    "e.g., 'Makes HTTP requests to user-provided endpoints'"
  ],
  "trust_boundaries": {{
    "description of input source": "untrusted|semi_trusted|trusted",
    "http_request_body": "untrusted",
    "cli_arguments": "trusted",
    "config_files": "trusted"
  }},
  "security_model": "Description of any documented security approach (allowlists, sandboxing, etc.), or null if none documented",
  "not_a_vulnerability": [
    "Specific patterns that should NOT be flagged as vulnerabilities",
    "e.g., 'Path traversal in CLI commands - user has filesystem access'",
    "e.g., 'Subprocess execution in agent tools - this is the core feature'"
  ],
  "requires_remote_trigger": true,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "evidence": [
    "List of files/patterns that led to these conclusions",
    "e.g., 'README.md describes this as an AI agent framework'",
    "e.g., 'Detected typer CLI framework in cli/ directory'"
  ]
}}
```

**Guidelines:**
- `application_type`: MUST be one of: web_app, cli_tool, library, agent_framework, openharmony_component, unsupported
- `requires_remote_trigger`: Set to `true` for web_app, AND for any cli_tool/library/agent_framework that PROCESSES UNTRUSTED INPUT DATA (a parser, deserializer, codec, file/format reader, or anything where `trust_boundaries` marks an input source `untrusted` — the untrusted data crossing into the code is the attack surface even with no network listener). Set to `false` only when every input source is operator-controlled/trusted.
- `confidence`: 0.0-1.0 based on how much information was available.
- Be specific in `not_a_vulnerability` - these will directly prevent false positives.
