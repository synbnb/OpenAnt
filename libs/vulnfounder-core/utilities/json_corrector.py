JSON Corrector

When the LLM returns a response that cannot be parsed as JSON, this module
uses an LLM to extract the structured data from the malformed response.

This handles cases where:
1. The model starts explaining before returning JSON
2. The JSON is incomplete or truncated
3. The JSON has syntax errors
4. The response contains multiple JSON objects

Note (issue #65): JSON correction inherits the parent phase's
:class:`PhaseBinding` rather than hardcoding Sonnet. For all-Anthropic
users this means Opus-phase corrections now also use Opus — a small
cost bump — but it's the only correct behavior for non-Anthropic
configurations where a "Sonnet" model may not even exist.
