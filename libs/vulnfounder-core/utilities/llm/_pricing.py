"""Lazy, registry-backed pricing for provider adapters.

Each adapter exposes ``pricing`` — ``{model_id: {"input", "output"}}`` — as a
class attribute. Before the ``config/models.json`` cutover that attribute was a
dict-literal snapshot materialised at import from ``utilities/model_config``.
It now resolves ``core.model_registry.pricing_map(<provider>)`` on FIRST ACCESS,
not at import, via the :class:`LazyProviderPricing` descriptor below.

Two properties this descriptor must hold (see CHECKPOINT Item 9 invariants):

* **Lazy, never import-time.** Reading the registry (and its JSON file) happens
  only when ``Adapter.pricing`` is actually touched — so ``vulnfounder --help`` and
  any import path that never prices a call stays independent of the config file.
* **Fail-LOUD, never AttributeError.** A missing/empty config makes
  ``pricing_map`` raise ``RuntimeError`` (via ``require_models``). This descriptor
  lets that ``RuntimeError`` propagate unchanged. It must NEVER raise
  ``AttributeError`` from ``__get__``: ``helpers.lookup_pricing`` does
  ``getattr(adapter, "pricing", {})``, and ``getattr``'s default swallows only
  ``AttributeError`` — an AttributeError here would silently degrade fail-loud to
  ``{}`` -> ``$0`` (the trap flagged by the paired-fix review at helpers.py:33).

Deliberately NOT cached on the descriptor: ``model_registry._load_config`` is
already ``lru_cache``d, so ``pricing_map`` is cheap AND honours ``cache_clear()``
in tests that swap the config. Caching a copy here would instead pin a stale
table across such a swap. Nothing mutates ``Adapter.pricing`` (verified by grep),
so returning a fresh dict per access is safe.
