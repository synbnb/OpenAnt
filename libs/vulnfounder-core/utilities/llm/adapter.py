"""LLM adapter interface — the contract every provider plugin satisfies.

Design notes (read these before adding an adapter):

1. **Minimal surface.** The protocol exposes ``complete()`` and
   ``validate()``. That's it. No streaming, no vision, no system
   tools, no prompt caching, no batching — the pipeline doesn't use
   them today, and adding them later is cheaper than removing them
   from a frozen interface. Adapters are free to use those features
   internally for efficiency.

2. **Unified content blocks are the contract.** Every adapter
   translates ``TextBlock`` / ``ToolUseBlock`` / ``ToolResultBlock``
   to and from its provider's native types. A future Gemini adapter
   that invents a ``ThinkingBlock`` to expose Gemini's reasoning
   field is welcome to do so internally but MUST surface only the
   three block kinds defined here. Otherwise pipeline code that
   inspects ``result.content`` breaks the moment someone swaps
   providers — defeating the point of the adapter layer.

3. **``supports_tools`` is static.** Phases that need tool calling
   (``verify``, agentic ``enhance``) check this attribute at
   config-validation time, before any call is made. If your
   provider supports tool use, set it to ``True``; if not, ``False``.
   A ``False`` adapter is still useful for the simple-completion
   phases.

4. **Errors are typed.** Map your provider's auth error to
   :class:`LLMAuthError`, its 429 to :class:`LLMRateLimitError`,
   etc. The pipeline's retry/backoff and user-facing error messages
   are keyed on these classes, not on provider-native exception
   types.

5. **Tracking is the registry's job, not yours.** ``complete()``
   returns raw token counts; the registry threads them through
   ``TokenTracker``. Don't update tracking from inside the adapter.

If you're reading this because you're adding a provider: also read
``docs/features/llm-providers/HOW_TO_ADD_AN_ADAPTER.md``.

      global) so each provider PR owns its rates and there's no
      cross-provider drift surface. Callers query it via
      ``getattr(adapter, "pricing", {})``; an adapter that omits the
