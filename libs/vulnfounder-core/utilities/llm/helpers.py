"""Convenience helpers built on top of the adapter interface.

Most pipeline call sites send a single text prompt and get a single
text response back — Stage 1 detect, JSON correction, single-shot
enhance, report-remediation. These don't need the full
``adapter.complete()`` plumbing (block construction, content
inspection, token tracking) at every call site.

:func:`simple_text` is that shortcut. Tool-use callers
(``finding_verifier`` and ``agentic_enhancer/agent``) keep talking
to ``binding.adapter.complete()`` directly because they need to
inspect content blocks and continue the conversation.
