"""Anthropic adapter — reference implementation of :class:`LLMAdapter`.

This is the only adapter that ships with VulnFounder's open-source release.
It implements the full ``LLMAdapter`` contract against Anthropic's
``anthropic`` Python SDK, and supports tool calling for the agentic
``enhance`` and ``verify`` phases.

Translation details:

* **Unified blocks → Anthropic content:** ``TextBlock`` becomes
  ``{"type": "text", "text": ...}``, ``ToolUseBlock`` becomes
  ``{"type": "tool_use", ...}``, ``ToolResultBlock`` becomes
  ``{"type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": ..., "content": ...}``.
* **Anthropic content → unified blocks:** the response's
  ``content`` is a list of ``TextBlock``-like and
  ``ToolUseBlock``-like SDK objects, which we walk by ``.type``.
* **Stop reason:** the SDK's strings ``end_turn``, ``tool_use``,
  ``max_tokens``, ``stop_sequence`` map 1:1 to our union. Anything
  else is normalised to ``end_turn`` to avoid breaking pipeline
  code on a future SDK addition.
* **Errors:** the anthropic SDK's class hierarchy maps cleanly to
  ours. A 529 ("overloaded") is treated as a transient rate-limit
  per the design call recorded in plan §10.

The adapter calls the existing global ``RateLimiter`` before each
request and reports 429/529 back to it, so multi-worker scans still
coordinate backoff the way they do today.
