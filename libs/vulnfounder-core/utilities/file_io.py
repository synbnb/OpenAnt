    A directory symlink in an untrusted repository is an exfiltration primitive:
    ``vendor -> /`` walks the host filesystem into ``dataset.json``, which is sent
    to the model provider.

    An earlier policy followed links resolving inside the repository or its
    immediate parent, to admit monorepo sibling-vendoring. The operator chose the
    stricter rule. It is also the simpler property to reason about: "never follow
    a link" needs no containment arithmetic and cannot be defeated by a target
    that resolves somewhere unexpected.

    **Accepted cost:** source reachable ONLY through a symlink is not scanned.
    That is unscanned code, so callers MUST count the refusal rather than skip in
    silence — a scanner quietly analysing less than it claims is precisely the
    failure mode this codebase keeps designing against. ``core/repo_walk.py``
    records these under ``symlinks_skipped``.

    Args:
        dir_path: The directory entry being considered.
        repo_real: ``realpath`` of the repository root. Unused under the current
            policy; retained because the containment arithmetic is the first
            thing needed if this is ever relaxed again.
        seen: Unused. Previously bounded cycles among followed in-repo aliases;

    traversal takes an entry's mode from a call that FOLLOWS symlinks, so

    Every path under a scanned repository is attacker-controlled: VulnFounder's whole
    job is analysing code it does not trust. A plain ``open()`` on such a path hands
    the repository three primitives:

    * a **symlink** to a host file, which lands outside the repo in ``dataset.json``
      and is then shipped to the model provider;
    * a **FIFO or device**, which blocks the scan forever on ``open()`` — no
      timeout, no error, just a wedged run;
    * an **unbounded file**, read fully into memory before any caller-side cap.

    This existed correctly in exactly one place (``load_threat_model``) while three
    sibling loaders opened repo-authored paths bare — the same "fixed it at the one
    site the report named" pattern that recurs throughout this codebase. Centralising
    it means the next loader gets the guard by construction rather than by review.

    Order matters: ``lstat`` before ``open``, because both ``exists()`` and
    ``open()`` follow symlinks, and a check that follows the link is not a check.

    Args:
        path: File to read.
        max_bytes: Size ceiling.
        oversize: What to do when the file exceeds it. ``"raise"`` (default) refuses

            worse than reading none. ``"truncate"`` returns the first ``max_bytes``

            would hide every large file from the survey and the caller reports the
            truncation. The choice is a parameter rather than a guess because both
            behaviours are correct for different callers.
