"""Regression test for the wait_if_needed TOCTOU on the backoff deadline.

wait_if_needed reads _backoff_until under the lock, releases it, then sleeps for the *entry-time* duration.
If another worker extends _backoff_until (via report_rate_limit on a fresh 429) while this worker sleeps, this
worker wakes before the new deadline and issues a request into the still-active backoff window -> more 429s,
thundering herd. Fix: after sleeping, re-check the deadline and keep waiting until it has actually passed.
