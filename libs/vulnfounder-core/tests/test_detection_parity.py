"""A7: Go<->Python language-DETECTION parity.

The supported-language SET is already guarded (test_language_registry.py / Go
TestSupportedMatchesConfig), and each runtime's detection is already unit-tested
SEPARATELY — but with independently hand-authored expectations, so the two could
drift on the SAME input (they historically did, on tie-breaks). This test and its
Go twin (apps/vulnfounder-cli/internal/languages/detection_parity_test.go) consume ONE
shared golden (config/testdata/detection_parity.json) so the expected outcomes are
single-sourced and cannot diverge.

This is the Python half: materialize each golden tree as empty files, run
detect_languages, compare the RANKED ordered list (or assert the error outcome).
