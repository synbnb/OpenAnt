"""Fix B — reachability blackout warning (advisory; never changes filtering).

The #75 zero-seed net only fires at EXACTLY 0 entry points. A library like
tree-sitter trips a handful of INCIDENTAL seeds (code that merely contains an
input-reading pattern), yielding a 96.6% reduction that looks like a successful
filter while the real public-API core was dropped. `blackout_warning` catches
both the total blackout and this partial-blackout-with-only-incidental-seeds case,
and stays silent for a normal app (real route/main/CLI seeds, moderate reduction).
