"""Adversarial fixture: one repository that attacks the scanner every way we know.

VulnFounder runs against untrusted third-party repositories. Every byte of the scanned
repo — file names, directory shapes, comment text, ``OPENANT.THREATMODEL.md`` — is
attacker-authored. This file builds a repository that exercises each known attack
in one place and asserts the scanner survives it.

Why a fixture rather than more unit tests: a nine-reviewer audit of the
multi-language work found that reviewers reading the diff converged on the same two
obvious defects while missing the majority, because most of these are not
diff-visible — they live in files the diff never touched. Every finding below was
found by *executing* hostile input, not by reading. So this fixture is the
regression surface: it keeps catching them, and it catches the next one for free
when someone adds language #8 or reporter #3.

Each test names the failure mode it prevents. A test that goes green because the
hostile construct stopped being *built* is worse than no test, so the builders
assert their own preconditions.
