"""The language registry must survive being installed, not just checked out.

``config/languages.json`` is the single source of truth for the language set. It
lives at the *monorepo* root, while the Python package root is ``libs/vulnfounder-core``,
so the wheel shipped without it: the registry resolved to ``{}``, ``-l python`` became
"invalid choice", and detection found zero source files in every repository.

That defect was invisible to the existing tests for a structural reason worth naming.
``test_language_registry_resolution.py`` exercises the search from inside the
checkout, where walking upward always finds the real config — so it passes whether or
not the file is packaged. A test that cannot fail is not coverage. These tests
deliberately leave the checkout.
