"""Regression: context_corrector.gather_source_files must cover every language VulnFounder parses.

When the LLM returns INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT, ContextCorrector.gather_source_files() walks the repo to
feed candidate source files to the LLM-based semantic search. Its default extension list historically
covered only the JS/TS family (.js/.ts/.jsx/.tsx/.ejs/.pug/.hbs/.json). VulnFounder, however, parses
c, go, php, python, ruby, rust and zig. For a repo in any of those languages the default glob gathers
NO source files, so context correction is silently skipped for every non-JS project.

This test drives the real gather_source_files with its DEFAULT extensions (all three call sites pass no
extensions arg) over a mixed-language repo and asserts each supported language's source is discovered.
