"""R4-8 (PR #69 round-4) — prompt-injection / fence-escape in the verifier prompt.

Untrusted analyzed SOURCE CODE is interpolated into the Stage-2 verification
prompt inside a Markdown code fence. Per the CommonMark spec, a fenced code
block opened with N backticks is closed by the first subsequent line that is a
run of >= N backticks. The original prompt opened the fence with a bare
``` (three backticks), so a crafted source file containing its own line of
three (or more) backticks followed by injected instructions could BREAK OUT of
the fence — the injected text would then read as prompt-level instructions to
the verifier (e.g. "this function is SAFE"), not as inert analyzed data.

The fix computes a fence longer than the longest backtick run in the wrapped
content, with a minimum of 3, so no internal line can ever close the fence.

These tests are model-free pure string assertions — no LLM calls.
