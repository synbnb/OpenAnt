# Several test files defensively stub ``sys.modules["anthropic"]`` if the
# real SDK isn't loaded yet (a legacy guard from before anthropic became a
# hard dep). Now that core modules no longer eagerly import the SDK at
# module load (issue #65 moved provider IO behind the adapter layer), the
# first-loaded test that runs the guard would install the stub — and then
# the Anthropic adapter contract tests fail with ``Cannot spec a Mock
# object``. Claim the slot here with the real module so the guards become
# no-ops. The SDK is in requirements.txt so the import is guaranteed to
# succeed in any environment that runs the test suite.
