"""Structural tests for the shared provider-model registry (config/models.json).

These replace the old ``test_builtin_model_ids_current.py``, which baked an
eternal, un-provenanced ``DEAD_MODEL_IDS`` set. The rule is: assert the SHAPE and
internal consistency of the registry, and that configured defaults resolve to a
non-retired entry — never that a specific id is alive or dead. Provenance
(``source`` + ``retrieved``) lives in the data, not in a test literal.

Freshness is deliberately NOT asserted by recency: a ``retrieved <= today`` check
needs the wall clock and is either flaky (fails as time passes) or a tautology.
So ``retrieved`` is required and format-validated only; staleness is an
operational/CI concern.
