"""Regression tests for CSV / formula injection in export_csv (CWE-1236).

export_csv() writes the verbatim scanned source (unit_code = primary_code) and LLM text columns into the CSV
with no neutralization. A scanned snippet beginning with =, +, -, @ (or a leading tab / CR) is interpreted as a
formula by Excel / Google Sheets when the analyst opens the file, enabling formula execution / data exfiltration
on the analyst's machine. Fix: prefix any cell whose first character is a formula trigger with a single quote
(the OWASP CSV-Injection defense), applied to every cell.
