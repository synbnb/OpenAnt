"""FIX1 RED: the Rust and Zig call-graph regex scanners run finditer over a whole
macro-body / function-body token text. On a long dotted/scoped identifier chain with
no trailing '(', finditer restarts at every interior position and re-scans the chain
forward — O(n^2) (measured: rust ~5.5s @32KB, zig ~4.5s @40KB). Possessive quantifiers
do NOT fix it (they stop intra-match backtracking, not finditer's per-position restart)
AND regress the match set on rust's scoped-turbofish branch (a::b::<T>( -> b). So the
edge-preserving fix is a bounded per-body scan input (the exact regex is UNCHANGED, so
zero call-graph edge change), truncating only pathological bodies with a logged gap.

RED pre-fix: utilities.scan_budget.bound_macro_scan_text does not exist.
