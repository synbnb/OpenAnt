"""The exploration tools hand a model read access. Confinement is the contract.

Request 2 asks for an agent that "goes over the repo". Giving a model file-read
tools over an UNTRUSTED repository is the only way to do that honestly, and also
the point at which a path argument becomes an injection sink. These tests are the
negative controls for that trade.
