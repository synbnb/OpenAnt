"""Thresholds must apply, and every exclusion must be reported.

Two defects, one fix:

1. The threshold rule was UNREACHABLE. `_select_languages_for` returns None
   unless --languages or --all-languages is passed, and both of those bypass
   thresholds — so `--min-language-files` / `--min-language-share` were
   advertised no-ops.
2. `LanguageSelection.excluded` was computed and discarded, so a dropped
   language left no trace anywhere.

For a security scanner the second is the dangerous one: a 4-file PHP upload
handler in a JS monorepo is exactly what the tool exists to find, and silently
skipping it to save ~0.1s of parse time is the wrong trade. Thresholds are
allowed to skip work; they are not allowed to do it quietly.
