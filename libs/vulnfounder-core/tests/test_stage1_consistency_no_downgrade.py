"""F-KB-1a regression: Stage-1 pattern-consistency must NOT silently downgrade a
surfaced (VULNERABLE/BYPASSABLE) finding to SAFE/PROTECTED.

At Stage 1 there is no per-finding exploit evidence — only pattern similarity, the
weakest signal in the pipeline. Letting it overwrite a vulnerable verdict to safe is a
silent security false-negative (the scan reports clean). The guard blocks downgrades,
records the rejected suggestion for audit, and leaves upgrades/lateral moves untouched.
