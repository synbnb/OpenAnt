"""Regression: gather_source_files must mirror the parsers' canonical skip dirs.

The default extension list of gather_source_files was broadened from JS-only to
every language VulnFounder parses (go/python/ruby/rust/php/zig/c). That broadened
walk now descends into dependency/build/VCS trees the JS-only default never
reached -- Python __pycache__/.venv, Ruby .bundle/tmp, a top-level .git, etc.
If exclude_dirs is not extended to mirror the canonical skip set
(config/languages.json -> skip_dirs, unioned with the extractors' skips), the
corrector "corrects" security context against vendored/generated code.

This test drives the real gather_source_files with DEFAULT extensions over a
repo that places source files BOTH at the top level (must be gathered) and
inside canonical skip dirs (must be excluded).
