"""F4 (docker sandbox egress hardening): the dynamic tester builds+runs UNTRUSTED
LLM-generated code. Network isolation must prevent RUNTIME external egress while
keeping the intra-network attacker-capture server (CWE-918) reachable.

RED pre-fix: _sanitize_compose only fixed version:/attacker image: and set no
network isolation; _run_single ran with a plain egress-capable network. A hostile
compose could keep external egress via a plain network, `network_mode: host`, or an
omitted `networks:` (implicit default). These tests lock the structural hardening.

This is sandbox HARDENING (opt-in --dynamic-test, already sandboxed), not a vuln fix;
build-time RUN egress remains an accepted, documented residual (not tested here).
