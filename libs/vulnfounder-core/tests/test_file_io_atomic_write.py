"""Regression test — write_json is non-atomic (truncate-then-write).

write_json opens the target in "w" (truncating it to 0 bytes) and then streams json.dump. If the process is
killed mid-serialization (SIGKILL / OOM / power loss), the target is left partial/empty and the previous good
content is lost → the next read_json raises JSONDecodeError. Fix: write to a temp file in the same directory and
os.replace it onto the target (atomic rename), so an interrupted write never clobbers the prior version.
