"""Consistency guards for the language registry.

These tests are the real deliverable of the registry work. The registry itself
is a small amount of code; what actually prevents the recurring bug is asserting
that every *other* description of the supported-language set agrees with it.

Zig is the worked example of the failure being guarded against: it was added to
``config/languages.json`` and to the parser dispatch chain, but never reached
``scan.go``/``parse.go`` help text or ``README.md``. Nothing failed, so nobody
noticed.
