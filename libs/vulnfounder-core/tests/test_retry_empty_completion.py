"""F21/F23 — a transient empty-completion ERROR must be retried in-run.

The provider adapters RAISE on an empty completion (no usable content) instead of
returning a fake SAFE — anthropic.py / google.py / openai.py raise
``LLMResponseError`` with the message "no usable content (empty completion)".
That surfaces as a visible ERROR (good, no silent false-negative), but the error
string matches none of is_retryable_error's transient terms, so the detection
retry pass in core/analyzer.py never re-attempts it in-run (only a later
checkpoint-resume recovers it).

The empty-completion cause is predominantly TRANSIENT (a thinking-block
truncation or a malformed/overloaded response), because the DETERMINISTIC
content-filter / policy case is a distinct exception, ``LLMRefusalError``
("refused the request (stop_reason='refusal')"), raised earlier. So classifying
"empty completion" as retryable recovers the transient case (mirroring the
parse_error fix) WITHOUT retrying deterministic refusals, whose message does not
contain "empty completion".
