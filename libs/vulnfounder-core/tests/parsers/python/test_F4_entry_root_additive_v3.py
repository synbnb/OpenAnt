"""F4 v3 — PURE-ADDITIVE entry-root recognition, proven as a STRICT SUPERSET.

Both earlier F4 attempts introduced a dropped seed (a security false negative) by
adding SUPPRESSION — a test-name / test-path guard that demoted a real
`@app.route def test_connection()` and real routes under a `test/` directory to
'test' and removed them from the entry-point seed set. v3 SUPPRESSES NOTHING: it
only ADDS route/entry recognition (custom-named APIRouter, aiohttp RouteTableDef,
Starlette websocket_route, Django class-based-view dispatch methods) ALONGSIDE the
pristine bare-substring `@app.route`/`@router.`/`@blueprint.` checks, which are
left untouched.

This test proves the STRICT-SUPERSET property directly: it runs the full
extractor -> detector pipeline over ONE fixture set on BOTH the pristine core and
the patched core (each in its own subprocess, so the two copies of the modules
never collide in sys.modules), then asserts:

    set(entry_points_patched)  is a SUPERSET of  set(entry_points_pristine)

so no pristine seed is ever lost, AND that every new custom-router / aiohttp /
Starlette / Django-CBV seed appears only after the patch.

The fixture set deliberately INCLUDES the two seeds the earlier unsound patches
dropped — `@app.route def test_connection()` and a route under `svc/test/` — and
asserts they are seeded on BOTH pristine and patched (anti-regression).

RED vs GREEN: on the PRISTINE core the NEW-seed assertions fail (those routes are
missed) — the pristine baseline is captured and asserted to LACK them. After the
patch the same seeds are present. If the patch were a no-op this test fails; if
the patch dropped any pristine seed the superset assertion fails.
