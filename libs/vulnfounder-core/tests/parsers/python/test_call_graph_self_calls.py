"""Regression tests for the Python call graph builder.

Bug report (dbt-core scan, 2026-04-26):
    `core/dbt/task/run.py:ModelRunner._execute_model` appears unreachable in
    the parsed dataset, even though `ModelRunner.execute` calls
    `self._execute_model(...)` on line 359.

Root cause hypothesis:
    The function code stored by `function_extractor` preserves the original
    indentation (methods sit inside class blocks, so each line starts with
    4 spaces). `call_graph_builder._extract_calls_from_code` calls
    `ast.parse(code)` on that indented body, which raises `IndentationError`
    (a subclass of `SyntaxError`). The except clause catches `SyntaxError`
    and falls back to `_extract_calls_regex`, which has no `self.X()`
    handling — every `self.method()` call silently disappears from the
    call graph. The blast radius is "every method call inside every method
    of every Python codebase," which matches the dbt-core scan stats:
    72% of functions isolated, avg out-degree 0.31.

These tests pin both the unit-level behavior (ast.parse on indented code)
and the end-to-end behavior (self-method call appears in the graph).
