"""Bug: functions/classes defined inside a BLOCK statement are dropped.

The Python extractor only recursed into `FunctionDef`/`ClassDef` bodies, never
into block statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`, `try`/`except`/`finally`, `for`/
`while`, `with`, `match`/`case`). So a `def` inside `if sys.version_info...`, a
`try/except ImportError` fallback, a `with`-guarded handler, or a CBV `if/else`
dispatcher was never a unit, never a call-graph node, and its body (including any
sink) leaked verbatim into the synthetic `:__module__` unit.

Investigated independent + judge (real interpreter). Fix descends into block
bodies at ALL depths (Python already keeps function-nested defs, so this matches
its baseline), reusing the existing keep-both (`#L<line>`) machinery, and closes
the `__module__` leak by covering every def/class span.
