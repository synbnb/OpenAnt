"""Tests for EntryPointDetector — a silent binary `main` (C/Go) classified
unit_type='main' must be seeded as a reachability entry point.

Regression for the gap where `main` was missing from ENTRY_POINT_TYPES: the C
and Go extractors correctly classify a program's `main` function as
unit_type='main', but the detector only honored unit types in
ENTRY_POINT_TYPES. A *silent* main (no user-input pattern, no decorator, not
module_level) therefore produced zero entry-point reasons, was never seeded as
an execution root, and every function it transitively calls was falsely marked
unreachable (reachability blackout on CLI/binary programs).

A program's `main` is an execution root by definition; over-approximating it as
an entry point is safe (a false-unreachable hides exploitable code), and a
library has no `main`, so this does not over-claim.
