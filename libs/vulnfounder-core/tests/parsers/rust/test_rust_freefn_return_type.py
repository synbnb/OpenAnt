"""a receiver bound from a free-function call
`let c = load()` where `load() -> Cfg` must type `c` as Cfg, so `c.validate()`
resolves PRECISELY to Cfg.validate -- recovering the unknown-receiver blackout the
unknown-receiver decline gate would otherwise cause, with NO phantom to a same-named method on an
unrelated type. This makes the receiver KNOWN rather than relaxing the gate."""
