"""Generic trait-bound dispatch for Rust (val_3_19 extension).

A call on a receiver whose type is a generic parameter bounded by a trait
(`fn f<B: Shape>(x: &B) { x.area() }` / `where B: Shape`) must dispatch to the
trait's conformers via the SAME `trait_impls` closure already used for
`&dyn Trait` receivers -- not decline. Nominal typing makes the conformer set
knowable and bounded, so this is a reachability-safe over-approximation, not a
guess. Mirrors the Swift parser's protocol-conformer dispatch (the reference
implementation this brings Rust to parity with).
