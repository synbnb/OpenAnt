"""Regression tests for the C call graph builder — builtin-name-collision leak.

Bug report (BUG-NEW-2026-06-02-c-builtin_filter_leak, VulnFounder base 601e588):
    A call to a *user-defined* function whose name collides with a C
    stdlib/POSIX builtin (e.g. `close`, which is in STDLIB_FUNCTIONS) produces
    NO edge in the call graph, because `_resolve_call` short-circuits with
    `return None` on `_is_stdlib(call_name)` BEFORE it ever consults the
    same-file user-function table. The callee is then falsely "isolated" /
    unreachable.

Root cause:
    parsers/c/call_graph_builder.py `_resolve_call` — the `_is_stdlib` filter
    runs first; the same-file lookup (step 1) is never reached for a colliding
    name.

Fix scope decision (see report): the pre-check is SCOPED to same-file
user-defined functions only. A genuine stdlib call (e.g. a real `printf` with
NO same-file definition) must still resolve to None — we must NOT route a
colliding name through a global cross-file single-match that could wrongly
link a real stdlib call to an unrelated same-named user function elsewhere.
