"""Deep-tree robustness regression for the zig call-graph tree walks.

Finding: zig-alias-index-recursion-no-depth-bound.

parsers/zig/call_graph_builder.py had TWO self-recursive parse-tree walks with
no bound on Python-stack growth:

  * `_collect_aliases_from_node` -- driven by `_build_alias_index`, which is
    invoked OUTSIDE the try/except that guards parsing. A deeply-nested parse
    tree therefore drove Python past its recursion limit, and the RecursionError
    propagated up and aborted the ENTIRE zig call-graph build.
  * `_extract_calls_from_node` -- the DIRECT TWIN, same unbounded recursion.

A prior draft fix added a static `depth >= 500` cap to the alias walker only.
That cap was ambient-stack-dependent (the overflow point shifts with whatever
frames are already on the stack) and, worse, SILENTLY TRUNCATED any alias
declared deeper than 500 nodes into the tree -- a real recall loss. The correct
fix rewrites BOTH walks ITERATIVELY (explicit worklist stack, zero Python frame
growth) so they are robust for any AST depth and never truncate.

This test drives the REAL top-level `build_call_graph()` entry (not the walker
in isolation) on a pathologically deep parse tree whose alias binding and call
site sit at the very bottom, PLUS a shallow control function. It asserts:

  1. build_call_graph() COMPLETES without raising (the recursive walk raised
     RecursionError here and aborted the whole build).
  2. the DEEP alias edge is still produced -- proving no truncation (the 500-cap
     draft dropped it).
  3. the SHALLOW alias edge is still produced -- proving no behaviour change on
     ordinary shallow ASTs.
