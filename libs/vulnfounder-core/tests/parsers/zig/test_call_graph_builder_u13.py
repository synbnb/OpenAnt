"""Regression tests for the Zig call graph builder (u13).

Three confirmed call-graph recall bugs, each reproduced through the REAL
extractor -> builder pipeline (FunctionExtractor.extract() feeding
CallGraphBuilder(...).build()), asserting the dropped edge is present.

- [BUG 3]  local-type dispatch: `const o = Foo{}; o.method()` (and the
           direct `Foo{}.method()`) produces no `caller -> method` edge,
           because call-name extraction never recognises a tree-sitter
           `field_expression` callee, so the method name is never emitted.
- [BUG 17] builtin-filter leak: a user-defined fn whose name collides with
           a ZIG_BUILTINS entry (e.g. `expect`) is dropped by the builtin
           filter before resolution, even though a same-file user function
           of that name exists.
- [BUG 41] const-alias dataflow: `const f = handler; f()` loses the edge to
           `handler`, because the name index maps only fn-decl names, never
           the simple const alias binding.
