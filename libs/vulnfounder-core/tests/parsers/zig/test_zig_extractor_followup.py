"""Regression tests for the Zig function/struct extractor.

Pinned against the actual tree-sitter-zig 1.1.2 grammar (the AST node-type
names below were confirmed by parsing sample Zig with the live grammar):

  - struct FIELDS (`container_field` nodes) must not be emitted as function
    units, and struct extraction must actually run. The extractor previously
    gated struct handling on grammar node types `VarDecl` / `container_decl` /
    `ContainerDecl` that the real 1.1.2 grammar never emits (it emits
    `variable_declaration` / `struct_declaration`), so struct extraction was
    dead code (0 classes) and the field/method paths were unreachable.

  - a struct method must appear exactly once, qualified as `<Struct>.<method>`,
    not duplicated as a bare top-level function. `_extract_struct_methods`
    emitted the qualified entry, then the unconditional child recursion in
    `_walk_node` re-descended into the same struct body and re-emitted the
    method bare because `current_struct` was never threaded through.

  - `tree_sitter_zig` was imported hard at module top level and called at
    class-body time, so a clean environment without the grammar package raised
    ImportError on import. The parser must degrade gracefully (importable; a
    clear error only when actually used).

The basename `function_extractor.py` recurs across parser packages
(c/cpp/php/python/ruby/zig), so this module is loaded under a unique name via
importlib to avoid any sys.modules cache collision.
