"""Disclosure-bypass FN: Stage-2 pattern-consistency must NOT silently downgrade a
conclusively-EXPLOITABLE finding to ANY disclosure-dropping verdict.

The anti-downgrade guard (``_has_conclusive_exploitable_path`` call site in
``_check_consistency``) originally blocked only ``{"safe", "protected"}``. But
``core.verdict_taxonomy.DISCLOSURE_DROPPED == {rejected, safe, protected,
inconclusive}`` — a consistency downgrade to ``inconclusive`` or ``rejected``
suppresses the finding from disclosure IDENTICALLY while BYPASSING the guard.
That is a silent security false-negative.

The guard's block-set must equal DISCLOSURE_DROPPED (referenced, not hardcoded)
so the two sets cannot drift apart again. These tests pin every dropping verdict
and assert a legit downgrade of a NON-exploitable finding still succeeds.
