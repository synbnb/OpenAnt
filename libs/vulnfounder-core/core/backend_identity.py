"""Minimal backend-identity fingerprints for checkpoint adopt-gating (I2).

VulnFounder caches per-phase LLM results in ``{scan_dir}/{phase}_checkpoints/``
keyed by ``unit_id`` (a PATH, e.g. ``file.py:func``). On a re-scan / resume
into a reused ``output_dir`` the phase ADOPTS those prior verdicts. That is
correct only when the SAME backend would have produced them. When the backend
identity has changed — a different model, provider, or adapter, or a different
static prompt template — adopting is a silent false-negative: the "scan" costs
$0 and re-uses answers a different backend never gave. Verify additionally
OVERWRITES the fresh Stage-1 verdict with the adopted one, corrupting the
report.

This module computes a scheme-versioned KEY that a phase stamps into its
checkpoint dir (``_fingerprint.json``) and re-checks on the next run. The KEY
is the invalidation identity: a change archives the old checkpoints aside and
re-pays.

KEY dimensions: ``scheme_version``, ``phase``, ``model``, ``provider_name``,
``adapter_type``, ``config_base_url``, a digest of the phase's STATIC prompt
template(s) (``templates_sha``), and any caller-supplied ``extra_key`` (verify
folds in the producing analyze run's fingerprint so an analyze-model swap
invalidates the dependent verify checkpoints too).

Deliberate exclusions (minimal by mandate):
  * NO endpoint DETECTION / drift_log / strict-mode — over-built, excluded.
  * NO credential-derived value (api_key). A credential-routing gateway (same
    URL + model, different key → different upstream) is a NAMED RESIDUAL.
  * app_context / threat-model is LLM-generated and regenerates
    non-deterministically every scan; callers MUST render templates with
    ``app_context=None`` so it never enters ``templates_sha`` (including it
    caused a VERIFIED ~17k-token spurious re-pay on a same-config resume).

Bump ``FINGERPRINT_SCHEME_VERSION`` when the KEY definition changes; it is part
of the KEY, so old sidecars invalidate cleanly.

RESIDUALS (named, not closed here):
  * ``config_base_url`` IS now carried on ``PhaseBinding`` and folded into the
    KEY (sanitized: userinfo/query/fragment stripped, so no credential is
    persisted). Two gateway configs sharing model+provider but routing to
    different upstreams now discriminate; default-config users keep ``None`` →
    digest unchanged.
  * per-unit content drift — ``unit_id`` is PATH-based, not a content hash. A
    body edit under the SAME symbol adopts the stale per-unit verdict.
  * cred-routing / api_key — see above (same URL+model, different key → different
    upstream is NOT discriminated; api_key deliberately excluded from the KEY).
  * the ``enhance`` phase is NOT gated: it is default-on with PERMANENT
    checkpoints and, across a backend swap, ADOPTS the prior enhance results at
    base — restoring a stale ``agent_context`` that feeds the analyze prompt and
    gates ``--exploitable`` / ``--limit``. Deliberately deferred (gate only once
    a stale-enhance false-negative is demonstrated).
  * the ``dynamic_test`` phase is NOT gated: it likewise adopts prior execution
    facts across a backend swap at base. Deliberately deferred (same bar).
