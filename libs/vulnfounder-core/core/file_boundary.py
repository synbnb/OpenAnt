"""Single source of truth for the multi-file unit boundary marker.

When a unit inlines its dependencies, the parser concatenates several files'
source into one ``primary_code`` blob and separates them with a marker. That
marker must be a COMMENT in the language being parsed — a ``//`` line inside
Python source is a syntax error — so producers emit it with their own comment
prefix:

    python, ruby              ->  # ========== File Boundary ==========
    javascript, go, c, php,   -> // ========== File Boundary ==========
    zig

Consumers, however, historically matched the ``//`` form literally
(``prompts/vulnerability_analysis.py``, ``prompts/verification_prompts.py``,
``validate_dataset_schema.py``, ``utilities/agentic_enhancer/agent.py``). For
Python and Ruby the split therefore never fired, and the fallback branch
handed the model the ENTIRE concatenation as the target function while
silently dropping the "Context (do NOT analyze these)" section — so dependency
code was analysed as if it were the unit under test.

The fix is to agree on the part that does not vary: the text between the
comment prefix and the end of the line. Match on that, emit with the right
prefix.

    This is the security half of the boundary contract, and it belongs to the
    *producer*. A consumer cannot defend itself: once several files are joined into
    one blob, a marker the attacker wrote and a marker the parser wrote are the same
    bytes, and no amount of pattern-tightening distinguishes them.

    The attack it prevents: scanned source contains a line that looks like a
    boundary. ``split_on_boundary`` then cuts the unit there, and everything after
    the forged line is relabelled "Context (do NOT analyze these)" in the prompt —
    so a repository hides a vulnerability from both analysis stages with one comment.

    This was not exploitable before multi-language support, by accident rather than
    design: the matcher required ``//``, which is a syntax error in Python, so the
    marker could not appear in real Python source. Teaching the matcher to accept
    ``#`` fixed a genuine bug (Python and Ruby units never split at all, so
    dependency code was analysed as the target) and simultaneously made the marker
    forgeable in exactly the languages that had just been fixed. Hence a
    neutralizer rather than a tighter pattern: the previous attempt to fix this by
    adjusting the regex is what created the hole.

    The replacement is deliberately visible rather than silent. The model still sees
    that a suspicious line was present, which is itself signal, and a reviewer
    reading the prompt can tell defanging happened.
