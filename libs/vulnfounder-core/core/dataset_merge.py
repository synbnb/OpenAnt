"""Merge per-language parse output into a single dataset.

The parse fan-out writes ``<run>/<lang>/`` directories, one per language, each
containing the same flat filenames. This module turns those into the single
``dataset.json`` / ``analyzer_output.json`` that the rest of the pipeline
consumes, so enhance/analyze/verify/report run ONCE over everything rather than
once per language. That works because the LLM stages are deliberately
language-agnostic (see DOCUMENTATION.md) — language is never used for rule or
query selection.

What is deliberately NOT merged: call graphs. There are no cross-language edges
to resolve (a Python call into a Go binary is not an edge any parser emits), so
unioning the graphs would imply a connectivity that does not exist. Instead
``write_call_graph_index`` records where each language's graph lives, which is
the single seam a future cross-language graph would attach to.
