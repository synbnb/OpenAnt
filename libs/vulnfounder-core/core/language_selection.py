"""Deciding WHICH detected languages a scan should actually parse.

Detection (``core.parser_adapter.detect_languages``) answers "what is in this
repo". This module answers "what is worth parsing", which is a separate
judgement: spawning a full Go parse for one stray ``tools/gen.go`` in a
5,000-file Python repo costs real time and, downstream, real tokens.

The policy is deliberately conservative in one specific way — the dominant
language is ALWAYS selected, whatever the thresholds say. That guarantees the
selection is never empty for a repo with any supported source, which in turn
guarantees multi-language scanning can never be *less* capable than the
single-language behaviour it replaces.

    Rules are applied in this order:

    1. An explicit ``include`` list wins outright — no thresholds. The user
       asked for these languages by name; second-guessing them would be
       surprising. Unknown names raise rather than being silently dropped.
    2. ``all_languages`` disables thresholds but still requires detection.
    3. Otherwise a language is selected iff its count clears
       ``max(min_files, ceil(min_share * total))``.
    4. The dominant language is always selected regardless of the above.
