"""Single source of truth for the supported-language set.

Before this module, four places independently described which languages
VulnFounder supports, and they drifted:

  1. ``config/languages.json`` — the extension→language map used for detection.
  2. The ``if/elif`` dispatch chain in ``core/parser_adapter.py``.
  3. ``argparse`` ``choices=[...]``, duplicated in two places in ``vulnfounder/cli.py``.
  4. Go flag help strings in ``cmd/init.go``, ``cmd/scan.go``, ``cmd/parse.go``.

The drift was not hypothetical: ``scan.go`` and ``parse.go`` omitted Zig from
their help text, and so did ``README.md``. Adding a language meant remembering
seven files.

``config/languages.json`` is now authoritative and everything else derives from
it. The legacy top-level ``extensions`` and ``skip_dirs`` maps are preserved
byte-for-byte, because the Go detector (``cmd/init.go``) reads the same file and
must keep working without a coordinated cross-language change; a consistency
test asserts the legacy flat map stays exactly the union of the per-language
lists, so the two representations cannot silently diverge.

Adding a language is now a config edit plus a ``parsers/<lang>/`` directory.

# parsed a single flag — `openant --help` died. The Go side already searched
# upward from both the executable and the CWD and degraded rather than failing

        parser_mode: ``"inprocess"`` or ``"subprocess"``. Python is parsed
            in-process; every other parser is a subprocess with a shared argv
            contract. This asymmetry is data rather than control flow so the
            dispatch chain can be a lookup.
        parser_script: Repo-relative path to the subprocess entry point, or
            ``None`` for in-process parsers.
        bootstrap: Optional pre-parse hook name (``"npm"`` for JavaScript,
            whose parser carries its own ``package.json``).
        fence: Markdown code-fence tag. Either a plain string, or a mapping of
            extension → tag with a ``"*"`` fallback for languages where one
            parser covers several fence tags (``.ts`` must fence as
            ``typescript``, ``.cpp`` as ``cpp``).
        docker_template: Template name for dynamic exploit testing, or ``None``
