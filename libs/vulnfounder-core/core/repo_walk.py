"""One repository walker, shared by every Python language scanner.

There were four: ``parsers/{python,c,php,ruby}/repository_scanner.py`` each
implemented recursion, symlink handling, stat-error behaviour and unreadable-entry
accounting independently. That is the mechanical cause of this codebase's most
persistent defect shape — a fix lands at the site a report names, and the other
three keep the hole. Traversal has now been fixed three separate times in this
subsystem (symlink guard, deep nesting, FIFO handling) and each time it reached a
different subset of the four.

Worse, the divergence hides from grep-style parity tests. Before this module,
``ruby`` recorded unreadable directories as ``directories_read_failed`` while
``python`` used ``directories_unreadable`` — a token-matching test that accepted
either would report both compliant, while ruby still recursed and still classified
entries with ``Path.is_dir()``. The property a reader cares about ("deeply nested
code is either scanned or reported missing") was false in a scanner the test called
green.

So: one walker. Language scanners supply *classification* (is this a source file? a
test file?) and *record-building* (what goes in the output row). They do not get to
re-implement traversal.

The three properties this walker guarantees, none of which were universal before:

1. **Iterative.** No recursion limit, so a deeply nested tree cannot blow the stack
   and get swallowed by a caller's ``except``. An explicit stack of *iterators*
   (not paths) preserves depth-first, name-sorted order, so output ordering is
   unchanged from the recursive form.
2. **Symlink-refusing.** Directory symlinks are never followed: ``vendor -> /``
   walks the host filesystem into ``dataset.json`` and on to the model provider,
   and ``loop -> ..`` does not terminate.
3. **Gap-recording.** Anything that cannot be classified or read is *counted*, not
   skipped. ``Path.is_dir()`` converts ``OSError`` into a silent ``False``, so a
   path past ``PATH_MAX`` reads as "neither file nor directory" and vanishes from a
   scan that still reports success. For a SAST tool that is a false-negative
   primitive and strictly worse than a crash, because it manufactures assurance.
