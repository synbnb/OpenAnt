        #      the repo names a real directory that os.walk already reaches on its
        #      canonical (non-symlink) path. Descending the alias would emit files
        #      under the symlink path and, worse, could suppress the real path
        #      entirely. We always drop the alias and keep the canonical visit.
        #   2. External symlink loops: a symlink pointing OUTSIDE the repo whose
        #      real target we have already descended (a self-referential loop)
        #      would recurse forever; an inode guard prevents re-descending it.
        # Traversal delegated to core/repo_walk.py. The previous implementation
        # used os.walk(followlinks=True) with an inode set that deduped only
        # REPEAT visits, so an external directory symlink was descended the first
        # time — `escape -> /` walked the host filesystem into the dataset. Both a
        # grep-based audit census and a token-matching parity test scored this
        # scanner "guarded"; only executing it against a hostile fixture found the
