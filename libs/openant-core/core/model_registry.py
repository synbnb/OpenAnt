"""Single source of truth for provider model IDs, status, and pricing.

Before this module, model IDs and prices were hard-coded literals duplicated
across ``utilities/model_config.py`` and the Go setup wizard, and a passing test
(``test_builtin_model_ids_current.py``) baked an eternal, un-provenanced list of
"dead" model IDs. ``config/models.json`` is now authoritative, read by BOTH the
Python engine (here) and the Go CLI (``internal/models``), mirroring how
``config/languages.json`` is shared. Each record carries ``status`` (OpenAnt's
shipped claim) plus ``source`` + ``retrieved`` (its provenance), so nothing
asserts a provider fact without a receipt.

Two invariants this module exists to hold:

* **A null price is NEVER a zero price.** ``pricing_map`` OMITS any record whose
  ``price`` is null (retired/unknown models). A null price must fall through to
  the cost tracker's documented "unknown model → warn, cost reported as \\$0"
  path, and MUST NOT be materialised as ``{"input": 0, "output": 0}`` — a truthy
  zero dict would price real tokens at \\$0 with no warning, silently corrupting
  cost accounting (and any budget ceiling built on it).
* **A missing config fails LOUD for real work, never silently \\$0.**
  ``require_models`` raises an "installation problem" error rather than degrading
  to an empty map, because an empty pricing map would price every model at \\$0.
  Unlike ``languages.json`` this file feeds no argparse ``choices``, so there is
  no ``--help`` path to keep alive — pricing is only ever needed for real work.
