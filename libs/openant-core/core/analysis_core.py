"""Stage 1 analysis primitives.

These three functions were defined in ``experiment.py`` — a research harness that
is NOT a packaged module — and imported from there by ``core/analyzer.py``. That
made the installed product unimportable: `pip install openant` ships the seven
packages listed in pyproject, `experiment.py` is a loose top-level file, and
``import core.analyzer`` raised ModuleNotFoundError in any clean environment.
Verified by building a wheel and installing it into an empty venv.

The dependency also ran the wrong way round: production reaching into research
code. It now runs research -> product; ``experiment.py`` imports these from here.

Nothing else moved. These were chosen because they are exactly what ``core`` used
and they depend only on stdlib and shipped packages (utilities/, prompts/).
