    ``short_name`` is LLM output (``vuln.get("short_name")``), and it used to reach

    sanitisation: ``/`` and ``..`` pass through untouched, so a name like
    ``../../../etc/pwned`` escaped the output directory and turned report generation
    into an arbitrary-write primitive.

    This matters more than a typical output-escaping bug because the threat model
    file is repository-authored and unfenced — the accepted prompt-injection gap is
    precisely a channel for steering model output, so treating that output as
    trusted compounds one accepted risk into an unaccepted one.

    unicode lookalikes and encoding tricks are excluded by construction instead of
