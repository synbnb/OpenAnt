"""
Output schemas for OpenAnt CLI.

All CLI commands produce a JSON envelope on stdout:
    { "status": "success|error", "data": {...}, "errors": [...] }

Human-readable progress goes to stderr.

Each pipeline step also writes a {step}.report.json file with
standardized metadata (timing, cost, inputs, outputs).
