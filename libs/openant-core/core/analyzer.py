"""
Analysis wrapper (Stage 1 — detection only).

Wraps the experiment.py analysis logic, accepting file paths instead of
hardcoded dataset names. Reuses the existing analysis functions directly.

Stage 2 verification is handled separately by ``core.verifier``.

Checkpoints are always enabled. Per-unit results are saved to
``{output_dir}/analyze_checkpoints/`` so interrupted runs can resume.
On successful completion the checkpoint dir is removed.
