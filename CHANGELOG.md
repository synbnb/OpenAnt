All notable changes to VulnFounder are documented in this file.

## [2026-08-14] — Recover reasoning-only (empty-completion) analyze responses

### Fixed

- **A unit is no longer silently dropped when a thinking-on model spends its
  whole token budget reasoning.** Claude-5-family models run adaptive thinking by
  default; on a large unit the model could exhaust the 8192-token `simple_text`
  budget on a thinking block and return no text, which errored the unit
  permanently (a coverage loss — the unit never got a verdict). The default
  `max_tokens` is raised to 20000 (under the non-streaming ceiling) so thinking
  and the JSON verdict both fit, and `parse_response` now scans the response for
  a lone verdict-bearing JSON object instead of spanning from the first prose/code
  brace, so a verdict emitted after a prose-and-code preamble parses. When several
  verdict objects appear (an example beside the real one) it stays an ERROR and is
  retried rather than guessed. Complements the in-run ERROR-retry added the same
  day: fewer units reach the retry path at all.

## [2026-08-14] — Configurable Python-subprocess timeout

### Fixed

- **The CLI's Python-subprocess timeout is now configurable via
  `OPENANT_INVOKE_TIMEOUT`.** It was a hardcoded 30 minutes with no override, so a
  large repo whose `analyze`/`enhance` phase legitimately ran longer was killed
  mid-phase — the deadline closes the subprocess stdout pipe, so the in-flight
  read returns `file already closed` and the phase's output is discarded, which
  then cascades to a missing-file error in downstream phases. The timeout now
  honors `OPENANT_INVOKE_TIMEOUT` (a Go duration like `2h`, or a bare integer of
  seconds), defaulting to `30m` when unset or invalid. Completed units are already
  checkpointed, so a re-run resumes; the override lets a single large run finish
  outright.

## [2026-08-14] — Local web UI

### Added

- **`openant serve` — a local, loopback-only web UI for the scan pipeline.**
  Submit a repository URL or local path from the browser, watch scan logs stream
  live (SSE), and read the HTML report / markdown summary / disclosures. Binds
  127.0.0.1 only (refuses a non-loopback `--addr`); outputs persist under
  `~/.openant/webui/`. Original work by @sounil, reconciled onto master and
  security-hardened. See the "Web UI" section in the README.

## [2026-07-22] — Efficacy harness rescoped to a smoke test

### Changed

- **The "efficacy" harness no longer produces a recall/precision number.** It was
  reporting `recall=1.0 precision=1.0` against a fixture whose docstrings captioned
  each unit `VULN` / `NOT A VULN` — text that reaches the analysis prompt (via the
  unit's `code.primary_code` and `metadata.docstring`), so the measurement only
  proved a model can read an English label. `tests/efficacy/score.py` is now a
  strict pipeline **smoke test** with a binary per-unit contract (flag the three
  planted vulns, clear the three traps) and no averaged headline number.

### Fixed

- **Blinded the fixture.** Removed the answer-bearing verdict docstrings; the two
  files (formerly an all-vulnerable `handlers.py` and an all-clean
  `maintenance.py`, a file-split that itself signalled the answer) are replaced by
  two neutrally-named modules with vulnerable and clean units interleaved. Expected
  outcomes live only in the sidecar oracle `tests/efficacy/oracles/<fixture>.json`,
  kept OUTSIDE the scanned fixture directory so the app-context survey agent (which
  can `list_dir`/`read_repo_file` anything under the scanned tree) cannot reach the
  answer key — a stronger guarantee than relying on the parser skipping non-`.py`
  files. Verified: no verdict marker remains in the parsed dataset, and no
  answer-key file remains under the scanned tree.
- **Deleted the fabricated baseline** `tests/efficacy/baselines/webapp.json`, whose
  `code_revision` named a tree where `score.py` did not yet exist.
- **Fixed the scorer's silent-failure modes.** A missing `results.json` (scan
  failure), an expected unit absent from the results, an unknown flagged id, and a
  duplicate id each now raise and exit non-zero instead of scoring a confident
  `recall=0.0`. The pure checking functions are unit-tested offline in
  `tests/test_efficacy_score.py`.

## [2026-07-22] — Go parser symlink containment (security)

### Fixed

- **The Go parser followed file symlinks out of the scanned repo (containment
  hole).** `filepath.Walk` lstat's each entry, so a symlinked file
  `leak.go -> /outside/secret` had `IsDir()==false` and a `.go` extension and was
  added to the file list and read *through* the link — the same host-file→
  `dataset.json`→model-provider exfiltration the Python engine's refuse-all
  policy already closed, never applied to the Go binary. The scanner now refuses
  every symlink (file and directory) inside the repo (the repo root itself is
  exempt), and an unreadable directory is a counted `directories_unreadable`
  coverage gap rather than a silently swallowed error. Proven by an executable
  containment test (`scanner_symlink_test.go`) with a leak canary + negative
  control; a mutation disabling the guard re-scans the symlinked file.
- **The `test_pipeline.py` Go build now rebuilds on staleness, not just
  absence.** Rebuild-only-if-absent left this security fix inert on any machine
  with a cached (gitignored) binary. The build now triggers when any `.go`
  source is newer than the binary.

### Changed

- **JavaScript parser reports symlink refusals as `symlinks_skipped`** (snake_case,
  matching the other parsers) instead of folding them into `directoriesExcluded`,
  and counts unreadable directories. Containment was already correct; this makes
  the coverage aggregator see the gap. Added the missing JS symlink-containment
  test (`TestSymlinkContainment`). With Go and JS now instrumented, they drop off
  `languages_without_coverage_data` automatically. Corrected the false claim in
  `test_scanner_contract.py` that Go/Node containment was covered by their own
  suites — those suites did not exist, which is how the Go hole shipped.

## [2026-07-22] — Artifact provenance + coverage; threat-model known risk

### Added

- **Context provenance in artifacts.** `scan.report.json` and
  `pipeline_output.json` now carry `context_source` (`"threat_model"` |
  `"generated"` | `"none"`) so a scan run under a repo-supplied security model
  is distinguishable from one under the built-in generator. Both artifacts also
  gained the multi-language coverage fields (`per_language`, `parse_errors`,
  `excluded_languages`, `degraded`) that `scan.report.json` previously omitted,
  and an aggregate `coverage` block reporting symlinks refused and directories
  that could not be read. All keys are additive; Go consumers use comma-ok
  access, so nothing breaks.
- **Threat-model provenance (R5 controls).** When a repository supplies
  `OPENANT.THREATMODEL.md`, the scan records `threat_model_sha256` (over the raw
  file bytes) in both artifacts, persists the previously-discarded
  over-permissive-model warnings (`threat_model_warnings`), and prepends a
  deterministic, non-LLM banner to the summary report stating that the security
  model came from a repo-controlled file. The sha key is **absent** — never the
  empty-string hash — when no threat model is present.

### Known risk (accepted, documented)

- **Prompt injection via a repo-supplied threat model is NOT prevented.**
  `OPENANT.THREATMODEL.md` ships inside the scanned (untrusted) repository and
  shapes the attacker model applied to every finding; a hostile repo can declare
  that nothing is a vulnerability. Per the project decision this is an accepted
  gap. The controls above are *visibility*, not prevention: the sha, the
  persisted permissive-model warnings, and the report banner let an operator see
  that a repo-controlled file supplied the security model, and detect the
  most-permissive case. See Risk R5 in the plan and the `load_threat_model`
  call site.

## [2026-05-24] — Pluggable LLM providers (per-phase llm-configs)

### Added

- **LLM adapter plugin layer.** VulnFounder's pipeline used to hardcode
  `anthropic.Anthropic` calls in 15+ files. All LLM IO now flows
  through `libs/vulnfounder-core/utilities/llm/`, a Protocol-based
  adapter layer with one provider plugin per file in
  `utilities/llm/providers/`. Three adapters ship today —
  **Anthropic** (reference), **OpenAI** (Chat Completions), and
  **Google Gemini** (`google-genai` SDK) — all supporting tool
  calling. Adding more (Ollama, vLLM, OpenRouter-native, etc.) is
  a small Python adapter recipe — plus a few Go wizard/probe
  touch-points if you want it offered by `openant setup llm`; see
  `docs/features/llm-providers/HOW_TO_ADD_AN_ADAPTER.md`. The
  surface is deliberately minimal — one `complete()` method, one
  `validate()` method, a closed set of three content-block kinds,
  a five-class error taxonomy. Closes #65.

- **Per-phase llm-configs.** `~/.config/openant/config.json` now
  accepts an `llm_configs` section that maps each of the seven
  pipeline phases (`analyze`, `enhance`, `verify`, `report`,
  `dynamic_test`, `llm_reach`, `app_context`) to a
  `{provider, model}` pair. Users pick an llm-config via
  `openant scan --llm-config <name>`. The built-in `openant-default`
  config (source-defined, frozen) pins today's per-phase Claude
  defaults, so existing users see no behavior change: a fresh
  install with no `llm_configs` resolves to `openant-default` and
  runs against Anthropic with the same model IDs as before.

- **`openant setup llm` interactive wizard.** Walks the user
  through creating a named llm-config without hand-editing JSON.
  Per-phase per-provider model defaults (e.g. `gpt-4o` for
  analyze, `gpt-4o-mini` for app_context, `gemini-1.5-pro` for
  verify), known-models hint shown once per provider per session,
  overwrite confirmation, and a 1-token probe per unique
  (provider, model) pair before save so a typo'd key surfaces
  immediately. Includes a heads-up that ChatGPT / Codex
  subscriptions don't grant OpenAI API quota.

- **Eager provider validation.** When a scan starts, the registry
  instantiates one adapter per unique provider in the resolved
  llm-config and exposes a `validate()` method that probes each
  unique `(provider, model)` pair with a 1-token call. Catches
  typo'd model IDs, revoked keys, and broken endpoints before the
  user starts a paid scan. Standalone step verbs (`openant analyze`,
  `verify`, etc.) probe their own registry at startup too.

- **Tool-support gating at config-validation time.** Phases that
  use tool calling (`enhance`, `verify`) refuse to bind to a
  provider whose adapter sets `supports_tools = False`. Error
  message names the phase, the offending provider, and what to do
  about it — fails at registry-build time, never at first call.

- **Contract test harness.** A 12-test parametrised suite runs
  against every shipped adapter (36 cases across Anthropic, OpenAI,
  Google; one tool-related case skips per adapter depending on
  `supports_tools`, so all three tool-capable shipped adapters
  execute 11 and skip 1) pinning each one's behaviour for text
  completion, tool-use round trips, and error mapping. Adding an
  adapter means adding one scenario factory file and one row in
  `tests/test_llm_adapter_contract.py::ADAPTERS`.

### Changed

- **`--model opus|sonnet` removed.** Both Go and Python CLIs replace
  it with `--llm-config <name>` across `scan`, `analyze`, `enhance`,
  `verify`, `dynamic-test`, and `report`. Backwards compatibility:
  `~/.config/openant/config.json` files that only have the legacy
  top-level `api_key` field auto-migrate in memory to a synthetic
  `llm_providers["anthropic"]` entry, so `openant scan` keeps
  working unchanged for upgrade users.

- **JSON-correction calls now inherit the parent phase's binding.**
  The legacy code hardcoded Sonnet for JSON correction regardless
  of the analyze phase's model. With per-phase configs this stops
  generalising — correction calls now use the same provider+model
  as the call whose response failed to parse. For all-Anthropic
  users this is a small cost bump on Opus-phase corrections; for
  non-Anthropic users it's the only correct behavior.

- **Unknown-model cost reporting is honest.** The pricing table
  used to fall back to Sonnet rates for any unknown model ID,
  which produced plausible-but-wrong totals on OpenRouter runs.
  Unknown IDs now report `$0` with a one-time stderr warning.
  Each adapter ships its own per-model pricing table; add entries
  locally if you scan against a newer model the adapter doesn't
  list yet.

### Fixed

- **Reporter no longer crashes on non-string response fields.**
  Some non-Anthropic models return structured dicts where the
  analyze prompt asked for plain strings (e.g. `attack_vector` as
  a JSON object instead of a quoted attack description). The
  reporter's `"\n\n".join(parts)` then raised
  `TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, dict found`
  mid-scan. `core/reporter.py:_coerce_to_str` now defensively
  serialises non-string values at every consumption site; the
  analyze prompt has been tightened to require string types
  explicitly.

### Removed

- **`AnthropicClient` class deleted** from
  `libs/vulnfounder-core/utilities/llm_client.py`. The file remains
  for `TokenTracker` (still shared across all adapter call sites)
  but the LLM-wrapper class is gone — every caller now uses
  `simple_text(binding, prompt, ...)` (for text-only phases) or
  `binding.adapter.complete(...)` (for tool-using phases) from
  `utilities.llm`.

- **`OPENANT_LLM_BASE_URL` / `OPENANT_LLM_API_KEY` /
  `OPENANT_LLM_MODEL` env vars are gone** (they were never in a
  release). Provider configuration lives in `config.json` only.

## [2026-05-12] — Parser depth, dependency UX, and LLM reachability (opt-in)

### Fixed

- **`openant parse` now defaults `--level` to `reachable`.** The Go CLI's
  `parse` command previously defaulted to `--level all`, contradicting
  `scan` and the Python CLI which both default to `reachable`. The
  documentation has always said the default is `reachable`. Anyone running
  `openant parse <repo>` without `-l` now gets the same dataset as
  `openant scan <repo> --steps parse` — the documented behavior. Set
  `--level all` explicitly to restore the previous output. (#35)

- **JS parser dependencies are now auto-installed on first use.**
  `openant parse` on a JavaScript/TypeScript repository previously failed
  out of the box with `Cannot find module 'ts-morph'` because nothing in
  the install flow ran `npm install` for `parsers/javascript/`. The Python
  parser adapter now runs `npm install` once on first JS parse using
  `node_modules/.package-lock.json` as the completion sentinel (catches
  Ctrl+C-interrupted installs). Python/Go-only users still never need
  `npm`. Includes a cross-platform file lock to prevent concurrent install
  corruption. Closes #6. (#37)

- **TypeScript parser now resolves dependency-injected service calls.**
  NestJS-style `this.userService.findById()` calls were previously
  unresolved in the call graph because the parser didn't extract
  constructor parameter types. Adds DI-aware resolution covering
  constructor injection (`constructor(private svc: SvcType)`),
  field-decorator injection (`@Inject` / `@InjectRepository` / etc.), and
  Angular's functional `inject()` API. Resolution priority: exact type →
  nominal (`implements`/`extends`) → unambiguous prefix (e.g.
  `CallService` → `CallServiceV1`). All steps return `null` on ambiguity
  to preserve the resolver's no-false-positive guarantee. Class-level
  metadata is keyed by `relativePath:className` so multi-module monorepos
  with same-named classes work. (#39)

- **Express anonymous route handler callbacks are now extracted as units.**
  `router.post('/orders', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {...})` —
  the anonymous handler callback was previously invisible to the analyzer
  because the call-expression argument list wasn't walked. Synth units
  now carry `route_handler` (last callback) or `route_middleware` (earlier
  callbacks) with HTTP method/path metadata. Both unit types are now in
  `ENTRY_POINT_TYPES` so the reachability filter doesn't drop them. The
  receiver filter (`app` / `router` / `routes` / `server` / `web` / `api`
  / `endpoints` / `controller`) prevents false positives on
  `myCache.get(...)` style calls. Named middleware identifiers become
  call-graph edges so `authenticateToken` shows up as an upstream
  dependency of the handler. Closes #21. (#49)

### Added

- **Auto-reinstall when `pyproject.toml` changes.** The Go CLI now hashes
  `libs/vulnfounder-core/pyproject.toml` (SHA-256) and stores the hash at
  `~/.openant/venv/.deps-hash`. Every `EnsureRuntime` call compares the
  stored hash against the current file and re-runs `pip install -e <core>`
  automatically when they differ. Eliminates the "user did `git pull`,
  dependencies changed, but venv is stale" silent failure mode that
  previously required manual reinstall. Best-effort: hash read/write
  failures degrade gracefully with stderr warnings rather than crashing
  the CLI. (#36)

- **`openant init` no longer requires a git repository for local paths.**
  Init on a non-git directory (tarball download, generated code, locally
  modified tree) now succeeds with `commit_sha` set to the `"nogit"`
  placeholder. `--commit` on a non-git directory warns and is ignored
  rather than hard-failing. Adds a shared `config/languages.json`
  consumed by both the Go CLI and the Python parser adapter — single
  source of truth for file-extension mappings and skip directories,
  eliminating Go↔Python drift. Language auto-detection is exposed as
  opt-in via `-l auto` (experimental dominance heuristic — see #61 for
  the validation work needed before it becomes the default). (#40)

- **`--llm-reachability` opt-in stage on `openant scan`.** A new optional
  review pass that uses Opus (default) to surface reachability signals
  the structural analysis misses — likely entry points (framework
  handlers, plugin/CLI registrations, message queues), external content
  ingestion sites (HTTP request bodies, file/network reads, env/argv,
  IPC), and async/cross-process data flows. Promote-only semantics:
  signals can mark units as entry points but never demote a unit the
  structural pass kept. When enabled, parse runs with `processing_level
  = "all"` so the LLM sees the full unfiltered codebase, then the
  structural reachability filter re-runs with LLM-promoted entry points
  added as additional BFS seeds. Output: `llm_reachability.json` plus
  per-unit `llm_reachability_signals` field on `dataset.json`.
  Cost-conscious: opt-in only, batched (default 25 units per Opus call),
  scales with total repo size rather than the filtered unit count. Off
  by default. (#50)

- **All parsers now write `call_graph.json`.** Previously only the Python
  and Zig parsers persisted this file; JS, Go, C, Ruby, and PHP did
  reachability filtering internally and didn't expose the graph. Required
  for the new `--llm-reachability` re-filter to work across all
  languages. Defensive WARNING in `scanner.py` fires with a cost-impact
  message if the file is ever missing for a language that should support
  it. (#50)

## [2026-05-10] — Windows compatibility & CI hardening

### Fixed

- **JavaScript parser no longer returns zero functions on Windows.**
  `path.relative()` and `path.resolve()` produce backslash-separated
  paths there, and ts-morph treats `\` as an escape character when
  matching paths it has already added — the analyzer silently emitted
  an empty result. The TypeScript analyzer now normalises every path
  it hands to ts-morph (and every value stored as a `functionId`
  component) to forward slashes via a `toPosixPath()` helper. A
  static-scanner test in `libs/vulnfounder-core/tests/test_windows_path_handling.py`
  enforces the contract on every commit.
- **`--files-from` no longer drops every path on Windows.** File lists
  written with CRLF line endings used to leave a trailing `\r` on each
  entry, which `addSourceFileAtPath` then failed to resolve. The
  TypeScript analyzer now splits on `/\r?\n/` and trims each line.
- **Pipeline status output no longer crashes on cp1252 consoles.**
  `parsers/{javascript,go}/test_pipeline.py` previously printed
  `✓ ✗ →` directly, which raised `UnicodeEncodeError` on the Windows
  default code page. Both pipelines now probe `sys.stdout.encoding` at
  import time and fall back to ASCII (`OK` / `FAIL` / `->`) only when
  the terminal can't encode the Unicode glyphs — UTF-8 terminals keep
  the prettier output.
- **`'charmap' codec can't decode byte ...` errors on Windows.** Bare
  `open()` calls and `subprocess.run(..., text=True)` invocations
  across `libs/vulnfounder-core/` defaulted to the system locale encoding
  (cp1252 on Windows), crashing on any source code containing non-ASCII
  characters (curly quotes U+2019, accented characters, CJK). All ~190
  call sites now go through new helpers in
  `libs/vulnfounder-core/utilities/file_io.py` (`open_utf8`, `read_json`,
  `write_json`, `run_utf8`) that pin UTF-8 explicitly. Four regression
  scanners in `tests/test_file_io.py` prevent reintroduction by failing
  CI on any new bare `open(`, `.read_text(`/`.write_text(`, `.open(`,
  or `subprocess.run(..., text=True)` call without an explicit
  `encoding=`.
- **Token tracker NameError on resume.** `core/analyzer.py` called
  `tracker.add_prior_usage(...)` without `tracker` being defined in the
  surrounding `run_analysis()` function. The path was reached only when
  resuming a scan with non-zero prior token usage — a dormant bug
  uncovered by the new lint step. Now uses `get_global_tracker()` to
  match the existing pattern in the same function.
- **Managed venv path is wrong on Windows.** `venvPython()` in
  `apps/vulnfounder-cli/internal/python/runtime.go` hard-coded
  `bin/python`, which doesn't exist in a Windows venv (the layout there
  is `Scripts\python.exe`). The CLI now branches on `runtime.GOOS` and
  returns the OS-correct path, so `~/.openant/venv/` is usable on
  Windows without setting `OPENANT_PYTHON`. New `runtime_test.go`
  covers both layouts.
- **Python parser test pipelines fail when invoked as subprocesses.**
  `parsers/{javascript,go}/test_pipeline.py` import from `utilities.*`
  but, when the Go CLI runs them as subprocesses with a different
  working directory, `openant-core/` was not on `sys.path`. Both files
  now prepend the openant-core root to `sys.path` before the
  `utilities` import.
- **Anthropic SDK auth-error test broken by SDK update.**
  `tests/test_silent_401.py` constructed `AuthenticationError("...")`
  with a positional message; the current SDK requires
  `AuthenticationError(message=, response=, body=)`. The test now
  builds a mock `httpx.Response` and uses the keyword form, and
  temporarily restores the real `anthropic` module so the real
  exception class is used.
- **`run_utf8` explicit-encoding test crashed on Windows.**
  `test_run_utf8_does_not_override_explicit_encoding` used
  `print('café')` from a `-c` snippet, which itself fails to encode
  on a cp1252 console before `run_utf8` even runs. The test now writes
  raw `latin-1` bytes via `sys.stdout.buffer.write(...)` so the
  encoding-override path is the thing under test on every platform.
- **`withTempHome` test helper didn't work on Windows.** Both copies
  (`apps/vulnfounder-cli/cmd/mode_test.go` and
  `apps/vulnfounder-cli/internal/config/scan_meta_test.go`) only set
  `HOME`, but `os.UserHomeDir()` on Windows reads `USERPROFILE`. The
  helpers now branch on `runtime.GOOS` and set the correct env var.

### Added

- **CI now lints for missing imports and undefined names.** A
  `ruff check .` step runs in the `python-tests` job before `pytest`,
  with `select = ["F821", "F811"]` (undefined name, redefined unused
  name). Both rules are zero-false-positive runtime-bug catchers, so
  contributors get fast static feedback on the kind of mistake Python
  won't surface until the affected code path executes. Scoped narrowly
  on purpose — widening to additional pyflakes rules can come later.
- **CI now runs Go unit tests on every platform.** A new
  `go test ./... -v` step runs in the `go-tests` job before the build,
  on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows. Catches regressions like the venv
  path bug above before the binary is built. The Python step also
  switched from a hand-curated test list to `pytest tests/`, picking
  up ten previously-CI-invisible test files (UTF-8 file I/O, Windows
  path handling, dedup, cwe-tagging, evidence-tier, and others).

## [2026-05-07] — Incremental scans + scan pipeline rewire

### Changed

- **`openant scan` rewired end-to-end.** The full pipeline is now
  explicit and visible in `--help`:
  `init → parse → app-context → enhance → analyze → verify →
  build-output → dynamic-test → report`. A single run-mode decision
  (full vs incremental) is resolved once — at `init` or at `scan` —
  and recorded in a per-run `meta.json` whose status field
  transitions `running → success | failed | interrupted`. Step verbs
  (`parse`, `enhance`, …) read that file and inherit the mode, so a
  standalone step after `init --incremental` filters correctly
  without re-passing flags. Docker is preflighted before any work
  begins, so a missing daemon is reported up front instead of after
  a full pipeline run.
- **Dynamic testing is on by default.** The opt-in `--dynamic-test`
  flag has been replaced by an opt-out `--skip-dynamic-test`. `scan`
  now produces dynamic verification of findings out of the box;
  callers without Docker should pass `--skip-dynamic-test`.

### Added

- **Incremental scans.** New `openant diff` subcommand and
  `--diff-base`, `--pr`, and `--diff-scope` flags on `scan` and
  `parse` scope the pipeline to changed files only. Go computes a
  `diff_manifest.json` from the working tree (or a fetched PR head)
  and threads it through every stage — parse → enhance → analyze →
  report — so each phase only processes what changed. The diff range
  surfaces in the CSV export, `_summary.json`, the standalone HTML
  report, the report header, and the live scan banner.
- **Explicit run-mode flags on `init`, `scan`, and `parse`** —
  `--full`, `--incremental`, `--diff-base <ref>`, `--pr <n>`, and
  `--diff-scope`. With a baseline present, an interactive TTY shows
  a recap prompt (default Enter = full, the safer choice); non-TTY
  callers without a flag get a loud error so CI scripts fail fast
  instead of silently picking a mode.

### Fixed

- **Python call graph no longer drops `self.X()` calls.** The call-
  graph builder fed function bodies straight into `ast.parse`, but
  method bodies are stored with their original class indentation —
  so `ast.parse` raised `IndentationError`, the regex fallback ran
  without `self.X()` resolution, and every method-to-method call in
  every Python codebase silently disappeared from the graph. On
  dbt-core that meant 2,243 of 3,116 functions (72%) marked isolated
  and a real scan returning zero findings. The fix dedents a
  temporary copy before parsing and leaves the stored source byte-
  correct so the disclosure renderer's offsets stay valid.
- **Disclosure code is byte-faithful to source.** The disclosure
  renderer pulls the actual file slice from the repo instead of
  rerunning an LLM rewrite, so every finding's `Vulnerable Code`
  block matches the real source.
- **No more silent 401s.** `openant set-api-key` validates the key
  on save and fails loudly on bad input. `openant scan` prints a
  blocking warning and exits non-zero when zero API calls succeed,
  so an all-401 run can no longer masquerade as a clean repo.
- **CWE tagging is systematic.** `pipeline_output.json` carries
  non-null `cwe`, `cwe_id`, and `vulnerability_type` for every
  finding. The Stage 1 prompt asks for them directly rather than
  relying on the renderer LLM to infer them from prose.
- **Repo metadata reaches every report envelope.** Repo name,
  commit SHA, and file count are threaded into `parse.report.json`
  and `scan.report.json` instead of being lost between stages,
  eliminating the `[NOT PROVIDED]` placeholders.
- **`Verified` column reflects the highest evidence tier.**
  `dynamic` > `verified` > `static`, so dynamically reproduced
  findings show as `dynamic` and the disclosure footer reads
  "Confirmed via dynamic test" where applicable.
- **Call-graph-aware deduplication.** When two findings share a
  sink/vector and the call graph records an edge between them,
  they collapse into a single finding.
- **Dedup matches on CWE** instead of `attack_vector` text, so
  small wording differences no longer split what's logically the
  same finding.
- **Dynamic test Docker context is complete on the first try.**
  `openant dynamic-test` pre-stages the vulnerable source file
  into the Docker build context end-to-end through the dynamic-
  test chain — first-try builds no longer fail because the source
  isn't in context.
- **Concurrency-safe Docker resources.** Docker image and network
  names get a UUID prefix so parallel dynamic-test workers can't
  collide.
- **Agreement filter checks the final verdict** instead of the
  intermediate `agree` flag, so high-confidence dynamic results
  aren't dropped by a stale agreement signal.
- **Report prompts respect non-interactive runs.** Prompt output
  goes to stderr (keeping stdout clean for piped JSON) and the
  prompt is skipped entirely when there's no TTY, so CI/scripted
  invocations no longer hang.

## [2026-04-29] — Python parser dedent fix

### Fixed

- **Disclosure code is now byte-faithful to source.** The disclosure
  renderer pulls the actual file slice from the repo instead of rerunning
  an LLM rewrite, so every finding's `Vulnerable Code` block matches the
  real source.
- **No more silent 401s.** `openant set-api-key` validates the key on save
  and fails loudly on bad input. `openant scan` prints a blocking warning
  and exits non-zero when zero API calls succeed, so an all-401 run can no
  longer masquerade as a clean repo.
- **CWE tagging is now systematic.** `pipeline_output.json` carries
  non-null `cwe`, `cwe_id`, and `vulnerability_type` for every finding.
  Stage 1 prompt asks for them directly rather than relying on the
  renderer LLM to infer them from prose.
- **`[NOT PROVIDED]` placeholders eliminated.** Repo name, commit SHA, and
  file count are threaded into every phase report envelope
  (`parse.report.json`, `scan.report.json`) instead of being lost between
  stages.
- **`Verified` column reflects the highest evidence tier.** `dynamic` >
  `verified` > `static`, so dynamically reproduced findings show as
  `dynamic` and the disclosure footer reads "Confirmed via dynamic test"
  where applicable.
- **Call-graph-aware deduplication.** When two findings share a
  sink/vector and the call graph records an edge between them, they
  collapse into a single finding.
- **Dynamic test scaffolding fixed.** `openant dynamic-test` pre-stages
  the vulnerable source file into the Docker build context end-to-end
  through the dynamic-test chain — first-try Docker builds no longer fail
  because the source isn't in context.
- **Concurrency-safe Docker resources.** Docker image and network names
  get a UUID prefix so parallel dynamic-test workers can't collide.
- **Agreement filter checks the final verdict** instead of the
  intermediate `agree` flag, so high-confidence dynamic results aren't
  dropped by a stale agreement signal.
- **Dedup matches on CWE** instead of `attack_vector` text, so small
  wording differences no longer split what's logically the same finding.

## [2026-04-14] — Initial public release

This release synced a large body of work from internal development. Highlights:

### Added

- **Parallelization** across all pipeline stages:
  - Stage 1 analysis (Detect), Stage 2 verification, Enhance, and Dynamic Test now run units concurrently via worker pools.
  - Thread-safe `TokenTracker` and `ProgressReporter` for correct aggregate metrics under parallel execution.
  - Shared HTTP client and a token-bucket `RateLimiter` (`libs/vulnfounder-core/utilities/rate_limiter.py`) to stay within Anthropic API rate limits.
- **Checkpoint / resume system** (`libs/vulnfounder-core/core/checkpoint.py`): every phase persists per-unit progress so interrupted scans can resume without re-running completed work.
- **Zig parser** (`libs/vulnfounder-core/parsers/zig/`): repository scanner, unit generator, and test pipeline.
- **HTML report improvements** (`apps/vulnfounder-cli/internal/report/`):
  - Two themes: dark (`overview.gohtml`) and Knostic-branded light (`report-reskin.gohtml`).
  - Report header shows repo name, commit SHA, language, total scan duration (formatted `Xd Xh Xm Xs`), and cost.
  - Findings are numbered (`#N`), have anchor IDs, and are grouped into collapsible sections by verdict (vulnerable / bypassable open by default; inconclusive / protected / safe closed).
  - Within each verdict group, findings are sub-sorted by dynamic test outcome (CONFIRMED first, NOT_REPRODUCED last).
  - File paths link directly to the repo at the exact commit.
  - Pipeline Costs & Timing section with per-step breakdown and a Totals row.
  - Executive Summary links to findings via `#N` references; priority labels (Critical / High / Medium) replace fabricated timeframes.
- **Dynamic testing** hardening: structured result classification (CONFIRMED / NOT_REPRODUCED / BLOCKED / INCONCLUSIVE / ERROR), Docker template updates, retry logic, and checkpoint-aware resume.
- `openant build-output` and `openant dynamic-test` subcommands with prompt-before-skip UX.

### Changed

- Finding verifier (`utilities/finding_verifier.py`) hardened with better error handling and agentic tool integration.
- Context enhancer (`utilities/context_enhancer.py`) overhauled for parallel, agentic enhancement.
- Report data pipeline rewritten: Python computes a `ReportData` JSON blob; Go renders the HTML template.
- Cost tracking reworked to report per-unit costs in progress output and aggregate correctly across parallel workers.

### Fixed

- Cost tracking no longer shows negative or incorrect totals under parallel execution.
- `merge_dynamic_results` no longer contaminates stdout, unblocking clean JSON output.
- HTML report entities (`>`, `<`) render correctly (previously double-escaped).
- "Max iterations reached" verifier timeouts now mark findings as `inconclusive` rather than leaving a stale verdict.
- Checkpoint resume behavior unified across phases.
- Stdin race during interactive signal forwarding.
